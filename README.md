# Dan' Tech Journal

Welcome to my tech journal! This is where I document my journal through learning and improving my skills, particularly focusing on web development.

## About Me
I'm Dan, a junior develper with a passion for learning and growing in the tech industry. I'm currently working with Angualr, TypeScript, jQuery, ColdFusion, MySQL and Ionip for app development.
I started my career in Jan, 2024, and I'm eager to expand/enhance my skills to become a better software developer.

## Goals
- Enhance skills in Angular and TypeScript
- Learn advanced JS concepts
- Explore new technologies by starting own my personal projects
- Document my learning process and progress.
